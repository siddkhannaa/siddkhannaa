### Hi 👋
I'm Siddharth, most people call me Sidd. I enjoy coding and robotics.
Currently working with Webdev stacks (mainly React and three), Python, and a group project scheduled to be finished around mid May!
(also a little dabble of unity and c#)

Fun Fact: 🐶 My Profile Picture is of a friend's old dog in a sock
